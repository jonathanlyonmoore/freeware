                                DBS-NETUTILS V1.0

This package contains four utilities that can be used to monitor the ethernet
to isolate problems or just to see what is going on.  The only documentation
available at present, is the NETWORK_UTILITIES.CARD which gives a summary of
the valid qualifiers for each utility.

Each utility should be invoked via a foreign command - MCR will not work.
The file DBSSYSRTL.EXE is a run-time library used by all of the utilities and
should either be put in SYS$SHARE or have a logical defined to point to the
file.

ETHERWATCH and LATWATCH will use a file ETHERWATCHER:NODELIST.DAT (if it
exists) which maps node names to addresses (a sample is included).

When specifying /FROM and /TO addresses, you can use a name as defined in
NODELIST.DAT (no wildcards) or you can use an address format which can include
wildcards.  If you use the UNKNOWN option, you must spell it out in full.

When specifying /PROTOCOL values, wildcards are allowed.

The images included were built on a VMS V5.5-2 system.
