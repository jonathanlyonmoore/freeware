DCLDBG, Programming, Debugger for DCL command procedures

A handy tool for debugging OpenVMS command language (DCL) scripts.

Kit contents:

* FREEWARE_README.TXT (this file)
* DEVELOPER_RELEASE_FORM.TXT
* DCLDBG_ORIGINAL.DCL (the "readable" version of the procedure)
* DCLDBG_OPTIMIZED.DCL (the "run-time optimized" version)
* DCLDBG.TXT (the original documentation, available in German only)
* DCLDBG.PDF (the User's Manual, in German and English)

Note: The ".DCL" files have to be renamed to ".COM" prior to execution
of course; in an effort to avoid strange "effects" they are intentionally
not included as ".COM" files.

Please read the PDF User's Manual for detailled information on the
debugger's invocation, command usage, guidelines and restrictions.
