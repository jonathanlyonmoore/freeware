PWAIT$SDA,UTILITIES, a SDA extension to display info about a waiting process 
PWAIT$SDA is a SDA extension (using the API first documented for VMS V7.2) 
which displays information about a process waiting and what it is waiting for.
PWAIT$SDA can be used to look at a crash dump or at a running system.

PWAIT$SDA is intended to help investigating why a process appears hung.

PWAIT$SDA has been built on OpenVMS Alpha (V7.2->V8.2) and OpenVMS Itanium
(V8.2-1)
