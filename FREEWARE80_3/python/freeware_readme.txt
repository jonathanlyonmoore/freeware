Python, Languages, Python Language for OpenVMS
Python is an interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum 
in 1990. Python is fully dynamically typed and uses automatic memory 
management; it is thus similar to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, Smalltalk, and Tcl. 
Python is developed as an open source project, managed by the non-profit 
Python Software Foundation.
