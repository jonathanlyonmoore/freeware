SDL, LANGUAGES, Data Structure/Interface Definition Language

  Version Info: V2.3-1

  The SDL tool compiles a data definition language module into the
  specified target language; the tool converts a language-independent
  definition file (an SDL input file) into a language-dependent
  definition file.  

  Whether alone or in conjunction with mechanisms such as the 
  OpenVMS MESSAGE/SDL command (a latent and undocumented qualifier
  which converts the .MSG file into an SDL file) and the Freeware
  GNM tool, the SDL tool can be used to maintain common sources for
  a wide variety of language files.

  This directory contains a PCSI installation kit containing the 
  current version of SDL for OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS Alpha, and 
  OpenVMS I64 systems.  To use this kit, use PRODUCT INSTALL to 
  install the PCSI kit, and the kit will install and register the 
  kit, including adding the SDL verb definition to the command tables.
