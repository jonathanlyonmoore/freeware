tnimage installation procedure

1. Make sure you have the correct version. If you don't have Motif, it is
necessary to use a statically-linked version (e.g., tnimagexxx-linux-static.tar.gz).
Motif is required for Solaris, Irix, and ConvexOS versions. For other 
operating systems, it is necessary to edit "xmtnimage.h" and "makefile",
and compile on your system.

2. Unzip and detar the files. If an older version of tnimage is present, it
must be completely removed from the directory in which you detar the new 
version. 

3. Edit the files "quickcam" and "umax" if you wish to use these 
devices.


Compiling:

7. Type "configure"

8. Type "make".
   If this doesn't work, tnimage can be compiled by copying ``makefile.oldstyle''
   to ``makefile''. Check the makefile to be sure it matches your operating
   system and configuration before typing ``make''.
   

Binary versions:

9. Type "Install" as root. If this doesn't work for some reason, tnimage
can be installed manually as follows:

  a. Copy the man page tnimage.1.gz to /usr/man/man1.
  b. Create a directory in $HOME/.tnimage.
  c. Copy these files to the desired locations:
          tnimage       /usr/local/bin
          tnimage.hlp   /usr/local/lib/tnimage
          tnimage.1.gz  /usr/man/man1
          formats/*     $HOME/.tnimage/formats/
          plugins       $HOME/.tnimage/
          scanners      $HOME/.tnimage/
          umax          $HOME/.tnimage/
          cameras       $HOME/.tnimage/
          quickcam      $HOME/.tnimage/
    

10. If you don't have write permission in your home directory, the message
"Can't save settings"  will be printed when you quit, indicating that any
configuration changes were not saved.

11. See Manual for details in customizing tnimage using
app-defaults or .Xdefaults files.
