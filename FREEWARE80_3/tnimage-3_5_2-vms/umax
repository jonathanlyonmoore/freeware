# If the scanner has a specific command for a given option,

# separate commands for bits/pixel, or separate commands for
# each resolution mode, while others have only generic color
# or grayscale modes. Separate options by spaces only.

# Commands which utilize numeric values. Numeric values, if
# applicable, are supplied automatically based on dialog box
# selections and should not be placed here.

# Conversion factors in case scanner driver uses some other units
# besides pixels at 300 pt/inch. For example, if driver requires 
# all units to be in inches, set each value to 72. If the driver 
# uses 1200 pt/inch, set each value to 4. Values do not have to be
# integers.

# Numbers which may need to be added to the contrast and brightness
# values supplied by tnimage (which range from 0 to 255) to convert
# to the range used by the scanner driver. For instance, if the
# driver uses -127 to +127, enter -127 here.
